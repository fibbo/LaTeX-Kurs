The distinction between a paragraph and a new line is very important in \LaTeX. For a new line you can either use two backslashes \texttt{\textbackslash\textbackslash} or the command \verb+\newline+. However just entering a new line with the enter key on your keyboard has no effect on the type setting of the document.

A new paragraph is either set by using a blank line or the \verb+\par+ command. The distinction between a new line and a paragraph is very important in \LaTeX{} and in texts in general. A paragraph should also represent a finished thought. A small unit of a coherent thought.
